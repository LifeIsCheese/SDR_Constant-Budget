A new year begins. Worldwide, the Great Depression is coming to an end, and the effects are being felt here in Germany. [? if economic_growth > 3 : The German economy is growing at an impressive pace, considering the worldwide recession. ?][? if unemployed < 15 : The unemployment rate has fallen substantially, as people across the country return to work. ?][? if inflation > 1 and inflation < 4 : Inflation is healthy, helping fuel the economy and bring down unemployment further. ?]

[? if return_to_normalcy : The Nazis have seemingly missed their window for subverting parliamentary politics and enter a period of internal reorganization. [? if sa_force + sh_force >= 50 : The threat remains, however, that they may attempt to seize power by force as a desperate last attempt at taking power. We must be vigilant. ?] ?]
